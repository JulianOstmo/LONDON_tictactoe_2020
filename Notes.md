# Scenario 0 - Game creation
âœ…- assuming the board is a "class" --> let it emerge.
âœ…- create the unit test to create the board
âœ…- drawing/painting the board somewhere --> console

# Scenario 1 - Player X paints the X pin on the board
âœ… Install eslint, prettier and jest types
`exec 3<&1;bash <&3 <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulolramos/eslint-prettier-airbnb-react/master/eslint-prettier-config.sh 2> /dev/null)`
âœ…- Game takes the pin, and places it on the board
ðŸ”¨- Create a player class (initialised with an 'X')
- Player can make move against a board

**Coding Goal**: Coding the Player X ability to paint an X on the board.

# Refactoring

âœ… - Add eslint & prettier
- Add fixtures for the different states
âœ… - Make cells a space rather than empty
