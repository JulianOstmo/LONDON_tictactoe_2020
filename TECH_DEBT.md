>> the team decided to pick-up the option of the board leading the logic to the rule engine creation....

RULES ENGINE???
- the move is outside the board
- the move is on a not empty cell
- ...

Describe Game Rules:
âœ… - The games initiates with an empty board
- Each player places its pin on an empty cell
- Player X is the first one starting to play
- A player cannot move outside of the board
- A player cannot move to a not empty cell
- Each player can take one turn at a time
- If there are no more valid moves, a Draw happens
- A horizontal win happens when three of the same symbols are next to each other on a horizontal line
- A vertical win happens when three of the same symbols are next to each other on a vertical line
- A diagonal win happens when three of the same symbols are next to each other on a diagonal line

Behaviours:
- After each turn we announce if there is a winner, and with what kind of victory they won
- Announce after each move if it's an invalid move
- If at the end of the game, and no one wins, we announce a draw (it happens after there are no more empty cells)

player placePin was difficult to remember
player position isn't self explanatory
  >>> suggestion: make constants in natural language (TOP, )
